    <p id="about-text">
    	Mariah is a Director and Motion Designer from Boston living in New York City. Her technical and creative background includes a B.A. in Graphic Design and 3 years of Art Direction in advertising. After falling in love with time-based narratives, her goal is to persue a career in the entertainment industry using film and animation to create empathy and highlight hidden stories. 

		<br><br>As a storyteller at heart, she is constantly on the lookout for ways to use the 2-dimensional format as a way of creating multi-dimensional worlds built around characters who exhibit unique human (or in-human) truths.

    <br><br>Her directing and video editing work has led her to complete projects within documentary/interview as well as short narratives for BBC Studios, The New School's Welcome Center, and Wilde TV.  

		<br><br>Advertising Recognition (Blood Thinner films): 
    <br>LIA Silver '18, One Club Merit Award '18, Cannes Bronze Lion '17, LIA Bronze '17, 
    <br>IPA Best of Health '17, Creative Floor '17 (3), Manny Award '17.
